## How is this from RATE MY NETA?

It is very different from it because, we not just rate netas, we compare them from each constituency, know about each voting state, know user sentiments even if they don't like any by letting them choose NO VOTE.

It is just about user logging in, rating neta based on their preference, but we will have info about the voting gained by each candidates of past, this year.
